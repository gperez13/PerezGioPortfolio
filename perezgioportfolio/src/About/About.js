					 I am a software developer with a knack for fostering 
					 relationships between people and data. Two years ago I 
					 moved to Austin, Texas and began working in the tech 
					 industry. The Advisory Board Company introduced me to 
					 what it's like to work in an enterprise setting and 
					 gave me a behind the scenes understanding of both 
					 software product as well as healthcare operations. 
					 Now that I am back in Chicago I am looking to contribute 
					 the performance of one of the best cities in the world. 
					 Because of my background in informatics, I can focus on 
					 immediate needs while keeping track of the big picture.

						<h3 style={{"font-family":"Crimson Text"}}> This is going to be an example of stuff</h3>
						  

					<p style={{"font-family":"Montserrat"}}>

					Creating community has always come easy to me. 
					As an extrovert, I look to break down walls and 
					introduce people to each other. Operating with a 
					positive-sum mentality, I build up my peers and share 
					opportunities for the benefit of the organization as 
					a whole. Through these soft skills I can simplify 
					complex ideas and deliver them to the end user as 
					readable data. </p>
